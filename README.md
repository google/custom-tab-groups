# Custom Tab Groups

This Chrome extension lets you configure a list of URLs to automatically sort
into (Tab Groups)[https://blog.google/products/chrome/manage-tabs-with-google-chrome/].
The configuration is entered as text, e.g.:

```
example.org = foo
example.com = blue
```

* example.org will automatically open in a Tab Group named "foo".
* example.com will automatically open in an unnamed, blue Tab Group.

This extension is experimental, so expect bugs/rough edges.
